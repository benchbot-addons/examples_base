  This example demonstrates how you can pass runtime arguments through to your
  submissions, both in native mode and containerised mode. Simple run the
  'benchbot_submit' command with the '--args' flag, and watch them being printed
  out by the example.
native_command: python3 .hello_args/hello_args
container_directory: .hello_args
