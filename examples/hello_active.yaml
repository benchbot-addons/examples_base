  This example introduces you to the "active" navigation mode in BenchBot by
  allowing you to teleop a robot through keyboard commands. It needs to be run
  for a task that uses "active" mode (i.e. requires the actions "move_angle"
  and "move_distance").
native_command: python3 .hello_active/hello_active
